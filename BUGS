- order of output PDF is not optimal, cannot be configured
- font size is often too small
- dead links to nonexisting wiki pages aren't ignored (WONTFIX)
- tables with header that are interrupted by a page break cause a rendering glitch on the next page (header is repeated and overlaps the next line, maybe a bug in chromium?)
